# Microsoft 365 - Message Center Posts Automation

## Summary

This solution brings the power of SharePoint and extensibility of SharePoint to Message Center Posts.

Admins struggle managing Message Center posts lists and come up with various solutions to track and manage M365 Message Center Posts. Some use Excel, Planner, Word, Email etc.

There is a Microsoft provided Import to Planner as well, but not easy to manage and view and extend as if this information was living in SharePoint.

This solution uses a List Template, Azure AD App, Graph API calls (and more) in Power Automate and brings the information in SharePoint.

We have created some default views to get started and some default columns in addition to the information column to track, manage each post.

Customers\\User can extend it to build powerful solutions on top of the SharePoint list to extend it. Like build a workflow to notify, remind, auto assign etc. (Not part of this solution)
